Device configuration for the Huawei U8120/U8100/U8110

Check out a copy of my u8120 device tree:
cd device/huawei
git clone --branch=t_dev git://github.com/joilaroi/cm9_device_u8120_joil.git

Copy proprietary files
either by running extract-files.sh with a device connected in 
or by running unzip-files.sh with a u8160 Froyo stock rom placed in as u8120_update.zip

Set up the build environment:
In terminal:
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch cm_u8120
make bacon
